                <p>
                Well, it all starts with four friends and their love for Kottu.Yatta, Don, Wait-for-it (HIMYM reference) and Poobala, as they are affectionately known, 
                all ventured into the food industry back in Feb 2018. Their vision was to let customers mix and match the carb, veggies, and protein, to create the perfect kottu for their tastebuds. 
                KOTTU SQUAD started with just Kottu and have introduced a wide range of delish appetizers and drinks.

                Kottu is such a beloved Sri Lankan meal and everyone has their preferred type of kottu. It's tough to cater to everyone's varied tastes but that's what the 
                create your kottu option is for!
